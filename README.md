Each coding question took approcimately 30 minutes each. As they are console application within Visual Studio, the end-user can simply run the application and follow the instructions on the screen.

1. How is a stack different from a queue?
In C#, both stacks and queue's are data structures. The main different between them is in how they handle elements. The stack manages elements through a LIFO methodology while the queue takes on FIFO.

Recursion is the process of solving big problems with smaller problems! In C# we can use methods of methods.
 
3. What are design patterns? Give an example of a pattern you have used.
Design patterns are object orient programming patterns that promote code readability and maintainability to combat several instances of the same problem the same solution, or design pattern.
There is the singleton pattern, factory method pattern, strategy pattern, observer pattern, decorator pattern, and others.
I'm sure I have used them in one way or another, but don't want to definitively say I have because I am not all that familiar with the actual names of the design patterns.
